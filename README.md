What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
This Git repo contains a few of my completed labs and assignments for COMP20
    at Tufts. It serves as a portfolio to my web programming abilities and
    skills, as well as a reference for techniques that I may use in the 
    future.   

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was creating the client side of notuber. I enjoyed it
    because this was one of the first times we were using XHR to get data
    from a server and apply it to our program. As well, this was the 
    first assignment that delved into using APIs to simplify our work (ie the
    GoogleMaps API). By succesfully interweaving these two imperative
    web programming skills, I got a good feel for how most real world
    applications work, and gave me the confidence to extrapolate on these
    techniques to use in our semester group project and possibly private
    projects.   

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I have grown immensely throughout this course. Coming into this 
    semester, I had minimal knowledge of most web programming languages, as 
    well as how the internet worked under the covers. Now, I can confidently 
    say I have a firm grasp on combining HTML, CSS and JS to create and run
    not only a simple website, but also the server side to an application. As 
    well as how the client and server interact through requests and responses,
    and the  various stages of this process. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two 
examples as evidence.
I believe the most important thing that we learned in this course was the 
    importance of CORS. CORS can be used to restrict who can have access to
    the server data. Ming has posted several examples of the importance
    of correct CORS restrictions on Piazza, two big ones include hackers
    reading private FB conversations and the other being a blog post
    explaining how you can easily exploit misconfigured CORS.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve 
deeper into?
After finishing the course, I'm excited to delve deeper into the security of
    what we have learned regarding databases and other websites, whether that
    be defeding against XSS or injections. As well as how to exploit these
    vulnerabilities.
