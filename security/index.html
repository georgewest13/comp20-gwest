    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> I have been hired to find the security vulnerabilities in James 
        Kaufman's server-side implementation of the notuber app, which uses
        Heroku. This product helps passengers find the closest driver, and all 
        drivers, and drivers to find the closest passenger, as well as all 
        passengers. Furthermore, this product stores the location and username 
        of all passengers and drivers who are using this app in a Mongo 
        database. </p>

    <h1> Methodology </h1>
    <p> I will be using curl in order to perform my pen testing. curl has
    limitless options of performing penetrations, including XSS, sending
    HTTP POST requests to a server, and injecting data into the database.
    Burp will also be used to try and alter request and response headers and
    bodies.</p>

    <h1> Abstract of Findings </h1>
    <p> This product is vulnerable to many penetrations. The most noticeable 
        being that it is extremely susceptible to hackers writing their own
        code that is executed by the product. Due to this, hackers can redirect
        the page, steal user's information, force the user to download viruses
        and so forth. As well, the product has severe confidentiality issues
        as anyone has access to every passenger's information, including 
        their location, as well as all driver's that have used the product
        in the past 5 minutes. This will cause a serious issue when the product
        grows to a larger scale. Finally, the product is vulnerable to 
        accessbility inhibitors as anyone can request vehicles/passengers as
        much as they want, restriction-free. This leaves the potential for
        saturating the fields of user's with fake users, rendering the product
        useless. </p>

    <h1> Issues Found </h1>
    <p> <span class="number"> 1. </span> <br>
        <span> Issue: </span> Database injection using XSS. <br>
        <span> Location: </span> On page 'http://serene-ocean-41337.herokuapp.com' which is the
        '/' path of the product. <br>
        <span> Severity: </span> High. This vulnerability allows any JavaScript to be stored
        as an element in the database, resulting in the scipt to be executed
        when the client recieves the response from the server. For example,
        the script could redirect the page, take the client's cookies, expose
        all of the databses data, etc. <br>
        <span> Description: </span> This was found in the app.get('/', ...) function in the
        index.js file. Since this function creates an HTML file and sends
        it to the client without any sanitization of data, it is extremely
        vulnerable and can be exploited within the username, lat or lng
        object values. The function is displayed here: <br> 
        <img src='XSS_vuln.png' alt="XSS vulnerability 1"> <br>
        <span> Proof: </span> <video width="320" height="240" controls>  
          <source src="vuln1.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>   
        </video> <br>
        <span> Resolution: </span> Sanitize input from HTTP POST requests to the database 
        by converting special characters to spaces. As well, make sure to cast 
        the lat and lng values inputted to be floats to avoid multiple places
        of potential penetration. </p>
    <p> <span class="number"> 2. </span> <br>
        <span> Issue: </span> Bad design pracice exposing user coordinatess. <br>
        <span> Location: </span> In the insertVehicles function, as well as the
        home page of the product - 'http://serene-ocean-41337.herokuapp.com'. <br>
        <span> Severity: </span> High. This vulnerability allows anyone to get access to the
        location of all passengers and when they were there as well as all 
        drivers within the past five minutes. This should be confidential 
        information, but anyone with knowledge of the POST address or the URL
        of the home adress of the product has access to this private data. <br>
        <span> Description: </span> This was found in both the insertVehicles
        function as well as the app.get('/', ...) function. When anyone 
        sends an HTTP POST request, the server responds with all of the data
        of the drivers active in the past five mins if the user requesting was 
        a passenger and vice versa if a driver was requesting. As well,
        on the home page of the product, all passengers who have ever used this
        ride-service will have their coordinates exposed and when. Due to this,
        anyone could find patterns in certain user's schedules and potentially
        harm them. Here is the function that posts all passengers information: 
        <br> <img src='XSS_vuln.png' alt="XSS vulnerability 1"> <br>
        Here is the function posting the driver's data:
        <br> <img src='drivers_vuln.png' alt="driver vulnerability"> <br>
        <span> Proof: </span> All passnegers information: <br> <br> <br>
        <img src='vuln2_1.png' alt="passengers information"> <br>
        Driver's within the past 5 minutes information: <br>
        <img src='vuln2_2.png' alt="drivers information"> <br>
        <span> Resolution: </span> Do not have a page that is public and contains all of the 
        user's data. As well, the server should have a whitelist of specific 
        domains that have access to the server data. </p>
    <p> <span class="number"> 3. </span> <br>
        <span> Issue: </span> Bad programming practice not restricting number of requestst
        from a single domain. <br>
        <span> Location: </span> In the HTTP POST to 
        'http://serene-ocean-41337.herokuapp.com/rides' <br>
        <span> Severity: </span> Low. This vulnerability has the possibility to overload the 
        server if there was a coordinated DoS attack on the server. However,
        with only one user making the attack, it just creates severe accessiblity
        issues. <br>
        <span> Description: </span> This was found in the app.post('/rides', ...) function.
        A malicious user can create a script to use HTTP POST to make hundreds 
        of requests per second, saturating the server with fake requests, 
        ultimately rendering the product useless as drivers and passengers
        may not be able to find real passengers or drivers for their service.
         <br>
        <span> Proof: </span> <img src='vuln_3.png' alt="passengers information"> <br>
        <span> Resolution: </span> Only allow a few requests per minute from a given domain.
        This prevents any type of attempt at an overload, even if the hacker
        is using proxies. </p>

    <h1> Conclusion </h1>
    <p> For the future, the creator of the product should sanitize all data that
        is inputted to the database which is cost free and a very easy thing to 
        do. All that is needed is one check that converts special characters 
        into spaces. This prevents many XSS attacks. As well, the creator should
        try to whitelist domains that can post data and recieve data to prevent
        exposure of client's confidential data and try to prevent DoS attacks.

        To complete this security assessment, I dicussed possible vulnerabilites
        with Gavin Smith and Ravi Serota. As well, I used
